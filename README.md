# Have Some Faith in Me

**by Sgmaniak**

I was bored so I wanted to try releasing a song on github. For those 2 or 3 people that might actually check it out, I hope you enjoy.

**made it with [Electron](https://electronjs.org)


- Written and performed by Sgmaniak
- Trumpet by Emmet Haden
- Mixed by Sgmaniak and Allan Fine
- Mastered by Allan Fine

## To Use

To clone this bad boy you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/sgmaniak/have-some-faith-in-me.git
# Go into the repository
cd electron-quick-start
```

If you\'re on a Mac, just click on that dmg file to check out the app...

LOL otherwise, you can build the application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
# build me up nice and good
npm run dist
```

Yikes, that should build it for windows or linux!
